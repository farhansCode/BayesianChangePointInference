# BayesianChangePointInference

This project is my final year project and it explores Bayesian techniques for detecting change points in time-series data. It uses the probabilistic programming Stan to identify the point at which the statistical properties of data shift, such as during an epidemic. The pdf contains the final year report so check that out.
