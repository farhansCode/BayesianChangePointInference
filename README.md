# BayesianChangePointInference

This project is my final year project and it explores Bayesian techniques for detecting change points in time-series data. It uses the probabilistic programming Stan to identify the point at which the statistical properties of data shift, such as during an epidemic. The pdf contains the final year report so check that out.

## Requirements

This project was developed using [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan), the R interface to the Stan probabilistic programming language.

### R Environment

- **R** version 4.4.1
- **RStan** (`rstan` package) version  2.35.0.9000
- **RTools43** (for Windows users â€” required to compile Stan models)
- RStudio IDE
- Windows 10

### How to use

Run the R scripts corresponding to a stan file. So for example run stageOneBiggerDataset.R .The R script runs the stan model.

### What I learned

R programming language,
Bayesian statistics,
Stan,
MCMC algorithm
